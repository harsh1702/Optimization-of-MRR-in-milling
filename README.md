# Optimization-of-material-removal-rate-in-milling
Optimization of material removal rate in milling of thin-walled structures using penalty cost function using MATLAB


To be done:<br>
<li>To verify whether the unconstrained optimization part will work in the main.m file.
<li>To input the required constraint as well as optimization functions for milling of thin walled structures as per the work of ringgaard et. al.
