# Optimization-of-MRR-in-milling
Optimization of material removal rate in milling of thin-walled structures using penalty cost function using MATLAB


Things that are to be added:-<br>
<li>A method to calculate the Jacobian for the set of equations.
<li>Add the optimization parameters as per the paper by ringgaard et. al.
